# Simplified Local Docs

The app will eventuall be a "Turbo Tax" for local docs of sorts. This is the backend for what will eventually be a [quiz for simple questions](https://malakdlo.github.io/easy-filing-frontend) + pdf generator which simplifies local document filing processes.  

By breaking down most of the questions from documents such as [this small claims form](http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc100.pdf) into 1) a quiz and 2) the form -> pdf generator, this app can help reduce the load of most local courts by turning the often unused FAQ sections into a series of questions arranged by local court experts that will handle the most simple, common questions users have.

Potential uses include providing a better experience / guiding people through filing for:
* Sex changes
* Name changes
* Traffic tickets
* Mediation
* Debt collection
* etc

Of course, since this will be a H4LA project that will be developed using limited time/resources, it will only handle the simplest of decision trees, eventually directing users to contact local self-help centers or courts if the logic is beyond the scope of app.
